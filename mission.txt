planing before coding

run the program :
loading json with the exe file

interace :
the interface projects the algograph to the user .
using menu bar he can choose options.


File :
    -Save and Load and exit
Nodes / Edeges :
    -geters adn seters /.

   Algorithm:
   -menu of algo .

algorithem :
TSP  ->   list of tsp nodes
using :
Center -> center node
using :
shortestPath  -> distance and list of the path .
using :
plotGraph -return graph with positions for the all nodes /. ( randomaly ) /
if there are some nodes : check MIN and Max  for random values .
else choose const MIN and MAX and choose randomaly between.

- tests
- comparing results with mathplot lib to show differences python to java time
- wiki and readme

****************************

actions of the program:
the user run the program, with json file.
so the program need to get a path to the json file
gui and algo are seperated.

running algo's


// we will just hold a referance to graph algorithm and execute the correct function of the algo
// then we will update the referance according to the output
